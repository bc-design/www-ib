## What Is Our Goal?

Indivisible Berkeley is a part of the national
Indivisible Movement. Our mission is to resist the
agenda of the current administration and promote
a progressive and inclusive agenda by effecting
change through the political system at all levels of
government. We seek to embrace liberal values
and promote inclusivity, respect, and fairness in
all of our actions.

## How will we pursue this goal? Values

Our team will uphold liberal democratic values, not only
in the political sphere but in our day-to-day interactions
with each other. This means inclusiveness, equality,
respect, and nonviolence in both speech and behavior,
especially in times of disagreement

Our team will assume everyone is acting with best
intentions, will educate each other generously, and will
search for common ground

Our team will speak truth to power. This means no
deception or underhandedness, but instead prevailing
with the force of facts, reason, and science


## How will we pursue this goal? Action

Our team will take relentless action, focusing on as
many direct political actions and engagements as
meetings held

Our team will act as one Indivisible Berkeley, united
through impeccable communication within and between
teams, coordination of major actions, and focus on our
shared vision

Our team will hold effective meetings that show we
value the time of volunteers, hear the voices of all
(particularly marginalized groups), and choose
deliberate next steps
